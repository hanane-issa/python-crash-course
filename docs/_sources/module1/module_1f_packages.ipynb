    "\n",
    "Python has a wide range of packages (pre-installed or third-party) that offer extra features like functions, data, and code to your programs.\n",
    "When you install Python, it comes with a standard library containing pre-installed packages such as:\n",
    "- os (for interacting with the operating system)\n",
    "\n",
    "- math (for mathematical operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "- sys (for system-specific parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "- datetime (for date and time manipulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you still need to import them since Python needs to know which tools you're planning to use.\n",
    "Think of it as your workshop—you have access to all the tools in the toolbox, but you still have to take the right tool out before you can use it.\n",
    "You can find a list of built-in Python modules [here](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Why doesn't Python load modules by default?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It keeps Python fast and lightweight by loading only what's needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It prevents naming conflicts by keeping modules separate until called.\n",

    "## Installing packages with pip\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend Python's capabilities, you often need to install third-party packages that are not included in the standard library. These packages are installed via pip (from PyPI) and can be anything from data science libraries like numpy and pandas, to web frameworks like Flask or Django, or machine learning tools like scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is usually done in your terminal via:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
