# Introduction to Python for Biomedical Innovation üß¨üêç


This guide is a hands-on introduction to **Python programming**, specifically designed for beginners in the **biomedical research** fields.

Developed by PhD students at the School of Informatics in the University of Edinburgh, the course uses biomedical examples to help you learn Python in a practical, applied way.

The aim is to help you get started with Python, giving you the core skills you need to work with data and code confidently.

## How to Use This Book

- Work through the modules in order  
- Try the practice sheets and examples  
- Don‚Äôt worry if you get stuck; debugging is part of the learning process!
