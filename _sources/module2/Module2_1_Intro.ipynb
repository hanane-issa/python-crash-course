    "Now that you have set up everything and know how to run Python code, we can get started with writing our first algorithms! In this module we will go over the basic building blocks you need to write a Python code such as variables, conditional blocks, and error handling. At the end of this module you will be able to already do some basic manipulations and calculations of biomedical data using Python code.\n",

    "## 1. Python Syntax\n",
    "Before we dive deeper, itâ€™s important to get a feel for how Python code is organised â€” in other words, its syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Indentation and Code Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, each new statement normally starts on a new line. This means you don't need to end each line with a semicolon `;`, unlike some other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also uses **indentation** to define blocks of code. In other languages, you might see curly braces `{}` or keywords to group code together. In Python, you just add spaces or a tab at the beginning of a line to show that it belongs to a block. One indent is usually either one tab (<kbd>Tab</kbd>) or four spaces (<kbd>Space</kbd>). \n",
    "\n",
    "When you indent a line, youâ€™re creating a \"child\" of the previous line. Usually, a \"parent\" line ends with a colon `:` (youâ€™ll see more examples of when colons are used when we cover conditionals later in Chapter [](M2-conditional-blocks-header)). You can also have multiple blocks nested inside each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "To end a block, just remove the indentation (using <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>). Itâ€™s also a good habit to leave a blank line between big blocks of code to make everything easier to read."

This line is only executed if `age` is greater than 18. \n",

It is very useful to have comments throughout your code.

Having comments alongside the code, explaining its purpose, makes understanding it a lot easier.\n",

    "\n",
    "While not technically part of the syntax rules, the `print()` function is a very useful feature, which is why we introduce it early on. As mentioned in the previous module, it is used to display output on the screen. In a jupyter notebook it will display everything in a print statement underneath the code cell. When running code in the terminal it will show all your print statements in the terminal. Print statements are very useful for keeping track of where you are in your code, preliminary results, and whether your code is working as expected. Note: in Jupyter notebook the last line of a cell will also always be displayed. But it is a good habit to always use a print statement and to not rely on the automatic output since your code structure can change easily."

It should have then an `if` statement that calls the `print()` function if `say_hello == True `. The `print()` function should output `'Hello, World!'`. Try to also add both multi-line and single-line comments to explain your code.\n",
