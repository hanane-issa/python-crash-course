## ðŸ’¬ Need Help? Create a GitHub Issue

If you run into **any problems** â€” whether it's with the notebook, the Jupyter Book, live coding, or instructions â€” you can **let us know by opening a GitHub issue**.

### Method 1: from the Jupyter Book

![open_issue]({static}/images/open_issue.png)

1. From the Jupyter book, you can navigate to the top bar where the GitHub icon is, and click on "Open Issue".

2. A title will automatically be generated based on the module and page you are on from the jupyter book.

3. In the description, include:

   * A short explanation of what the issue is
   * Where you encountered it (e.g. module, notebook, or section name)
   * A screenshot or code snippet if possible

### Method 2: via the Repository

![locate_repo]({static}/images/locate_repo.png)

1. Go to our course GitHub repository:
   ðŸ‘‰ \[[HERE](https://github.com/hanane-issa/python-crash-course)]


![github_issues_tab]({static}/images/github-issue1.png)
2. Click on the **"Issues"** tab.


![github_issues_create]({static}/images/github-issue2.png)
3. Click **"New issue"** (green button).

4. Add a **clear title**, like:
   `Broken image in Module 1` or `Code example not working in Module 2`

5. Just like in method 1, in the description, include:

   * A short explanation of what the issue is
   * Where you encountered it (e.g. module, notebook, or section name)
   * A screenshot or code snippet if possible

6. Click **"Submit new issue"**.
