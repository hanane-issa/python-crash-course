# Welcome to Module 5

In this module, we will go through how to visualize data using python. We will use 2 very popular package to do so: Matplotlib and Seaborn.

If you have not done so already, install both Matplotlib and Seaborn by running the following command in the terminal:

```
pip install matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy pandas
```

We will be using the [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset?resource=download) on kaggle.

This module assumes that you have gone through module 4 and learned how to load data and handle a dataframe in python.
