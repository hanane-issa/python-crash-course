    "## Why write a function? \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reuse code easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "As you start coding and analyzing data in Python, you'll soon realize that some code snippets are repeated and can be reused. Instead of copying and pasting the same code again and again, you write it once as a function and use it whenever you need. This saves time and effort!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make your code cleaner and shorter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions help break big problems into smaller, manageable pieces. This makes your code easier to read and understand. We often talk about avoiding 'spaghetti code'. Just as it sounds, this describes code that is unclear, a big tangled mess that’s tough to read, understand, and work with,—kind of like a bowl of spaghetti all mixed up. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avoid mistakes:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reuse the same function, you only need to test and fix the code once. This reduces errors compared to copying code multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Organize your work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions let you give a name to a block of code, which describes what it does. This helps others (and future you!) understand your program faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the building blocks of a function? What elements do we need for Python to understand that we're defining a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the syntax needed:\n",

    "<img src=\"../_static/images/function_annotation.png\" alt=\"function_explanation\" style=\"width: 1400px; height: 300px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, a function requires parameters to define the type and number of values that it can accept {cite}`params_vs_args`. These parameters are placeholders for the actual data you want to pass when you call the function. If your function were a vending machine, then the parameters are the buttons you press to choose what comes out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "You only need to define a function once, then you can use (call) it as many times as you like.\n",
    "```\n",
