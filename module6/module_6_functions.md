<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">
<b>Module 1 Objectives:</b><br> 
By the end of this module, you will be able to:<br><br>

- Understand how to define a function in a programming language.<br> 
- Learn how to call a function to execute its code.<br>
- Understand the concept of return values from functions versus functions that only print output without returning values.<br>
- Differentiate between local and global variables.<br>
- Write and utilize docstrings to document functions.<br> 
- Differentiate between arguments and parameters in functions.<br>
- Recognize how the number of arguments affects function calls and definitions.<br> 
- Implement default parameter values in function definitions.<br> 
</div>

In the previous sections, we've talked about several built-in functions like `print()` and `input()`, as well as functions from installed packages like NumPy's `array()` and pandas' `read_csv()`.

Now we'll talk about how you can write your own functions.
