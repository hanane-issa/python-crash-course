# Executing the Notebook Exercices

After each module, you can test your knowledge with a coding exercice in a jupyter notebook file.
You can run the notebooks in three different ways, depending on your preference and setup:

1. Run in Google Colab
- Easiest option — no setup needed.

- Just click the “Open in Colab” button at the top of each exercice notebook page in this book.

- It runs in your browser and saves changes to your Google Drive (if you sign in).

```

2. Run on Binder

- Great if you want a full coding environment in your browser.

- Just click the “Open in Binder” button at the top of each exercice notebook page in this book.

- Binder launches a temporary Jupyter environment.

- No installation required, but it takes a minute to load.


3. Download and Run Locally

- Best for learning how to run Python on your own machine.

- Download the notebook (.ipynb) from GitHub.

- Open it using your preferred code editor/IDE, e.g. VSCode.
