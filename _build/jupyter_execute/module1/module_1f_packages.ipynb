    "# Installing Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install Python, it comes with a standard library containing pre-installed packages such as:\n",
    "- os (for interacting with the operating system)\n",
    "\n",
    "- math (for mathematical operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "- sys (for system-specific parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "- datetime (for date and time manipulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you still need to import them since Python needs to know which tools you're planning to use.\n",
    "Think of it as your workshop—you have access to all the tools in the toolbox, but you still have to take the right tool out before you can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Why doesn't Python load modules by default?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It keeps Python fast and lightweight by loading only what's needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It prevents naming conflicts by keeping modules separate until called.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It lets you explicitly control what your code depends on.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Installing packages with pip\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend Python's capabilities, you often need to install third-party packages that are not included in the standard library. These packages are installed via pip (from PyPI) and can be anything from data science libraries like numpy and pandas, to web frameworks like Flask or Django, or machine learning tools like scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is usually done in your terminal via:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `pandas` is a package for data manipulation and analysis that you'll learn about in module 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run this shell command in your jupyter notebook, by adding a ! or % before pip ( [see more on stackoverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45784499/what-is-the-difference-between-and-in-jupyter-notebooks) )."
