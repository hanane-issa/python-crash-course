    "\n",
    "- Values can be stored in variables, making them easy to recall, use, and manipulate\n",
    "- Variables are defined using equal signs `=` and can be changed by reassigning a new value\n",
    "- Each variable has a data type defining what type of information they contain and how it can be manipulated. Python automatically infers the data type from the value\n",
    "- Common data types are numerical data (integers and floats), boolean, and strings\n",
    "- Other data types are sequence types/ data structures which store multiple data points, e.g. tuples `()`, lists `[]`, sets `{}`, and dictionaries `{key:value}`\n",
    "- Each data type has specific functions, methods, and operators that can be used to manipulate them, e.g. arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators\n",
    "- To make manipulations easier one can define conditional blocks, which can be used to define which block should be carried out, how often, and with which variable values\n",
    "- Running into errors is normal - clear variable names, comments, print statements, and try-expect statements are your best friend in identify where they come from"

Loop through each participant. Compute their BMI and check whether it is below 18.5 (i.e. underweight), between (or equal to) 18.5 - 25 (normal range) or over 25 (overweight). Do this by using `if-else` statements (there should be 3 in total). For each statement print the participant number, their gender, their BMI value and whether they are underweight, normal range or overweight."
