    "In programming, **errors** (also called **exceptions**) are problems that occur during the execution of a programme. \n",
    "\n",
    "If errors are not handled, they can cause the programme to crash or to not carry out the code as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of errors which can be sorted into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax errors**: Mistakes in the code that prevent Python from understanding it since it violates its rules (e.g., missing a colon).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logical errors**: Mistakes in using the correct logic leading to wrong outputs (e.g. using > instead of <)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Runtime errors**: Problems that happen while the programme is running preventing it from compiling (e.g. dividing by zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Limit Exceeded error**: Error when the code take to long to execute (e.g stuck in a while loop)"

Similarly, `try-except` blocks allow a programme to react differently depending on whether an error occurs during execution. Python tries to execute the code inside the `try:` block. If an error occurs while executing the code in the block, it jumps to the `except:` block."

    "`try-except` statements are very useful but they can only capture errors that interrupt the code / hinder it from being carried out. Often the code syntax is completely correct but its output is still wrong. These are due the code having a logic error somewhere. These errors are often a lot harder to capture or one might not even be aware of them. Make sure that you output your intermediate results, double-check all your code (for example by testing a sub-part of it whether it does what it should do - these are called *Unit tests* which are out of the scope of this tutorial but there exist various sources online), and add useful comments and variable names to reduced the chance of getting a logic error and/ or not being able to identify where it comes from."
