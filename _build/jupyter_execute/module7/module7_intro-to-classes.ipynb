    "\n",
    "In layman's terms, classes are templates/blueprints that you make your objects out of and objects are instances of a class. In Python, almost everything in Python is an object. For exmaple, a string like \"dog\" is an object of the `str` class. Another example, what you learned in module 4, `pandas.DataFrame` is a class, and when you load a csv file using this class, you have created an object of the class `pandas.DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. OOP is a paradigm that centers around the concepts of objects. However, Python would also allow you to go away from OOP and use other programming style such as procedural and functional, meaning you don't have to use objects if you don't want to."
