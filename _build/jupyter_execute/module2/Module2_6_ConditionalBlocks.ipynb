    "### 6.1. What is a Conditional Block?\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional blocks allow your programme to make decisions. They control the flow of execution depending on whether a certain condition is `True` or `False`. You can either have conditional statement, where a block is carried out once if a condition is met, or a conditional loop where the block is carried out repeatedly as long as the condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common conditional blocks are:\n",
    "- `if-else` statement: carries the block out if a condition is `True` and other else (perhaps) another block\n",
    "- `while` loop : carries out the block repetitively in a loop as long as some condition is true\n",
    "- `for` loop: carries out the same block for different variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional block consists of the condition and the body. The condition is defined by the key word (`if`,`for`, and `while`) + the condition (using conditional operators) + colon `:`. Afterwards the body, which is the code block that should be executed, is given, which is indented to show that it is the child of the condition. The body stops when the code is no longer indented but on the same line as the condition again.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already seen an example of such a block in the first chapter: the `if` statement to check the patient's age."
