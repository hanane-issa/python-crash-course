    "\n",
    "- Values can be stored in variables, making them easy to recall, use, and manipulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables are defined using equal signs `=` and can be changed by reassigning a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each variable has a data type defining what type of information it contains and how it can be manipulated. Python automatically infers the data type from the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common data types are numerical data (integers and floats), booleans, and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other data types are sequence types/data structures which store multiple data points, e.g. tuples `()`, lists `[]`, sets `{}`, and dictionaries `{key: value}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each data type has specific functions, methods, and operators that can be used to manipulate them, e.g. arithmetic operators, comparison operators, and logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make manipulations easier, one can define conditional blocks, which specify which block should be carried out, how often, and with which variable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Running into errors is normal â€“ clear variable names, comments, print statements, and try-except statements are your best friends in identifying where they come from."
