The goal of this module is to help you commeorate what you have learned. We will use a new dataset that you will have to analyse and investigate. We will give you different excercise with the goal that you complete them on your own without much external help. If you are stuck, first try to give it a good effort on you own. If that does not help, you can go back to the earlier modules to refresh your mind, and if that is not enough use google or the solution sheet to look it up."
